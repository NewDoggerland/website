This Discovery Pack v1 folder includes an anchored facts.json derived from the uploaded v0.5 governance ZIP.

Anchored (has citations into canonical .tex files):
- Governance Schedule Index force rule
- Schedule B emergency scope bound
- Schedule D logging gate
- DAF overview donor-funds unilateral control constraint
- External Summary donor-fund protections signal

Not anchored (explicitly marked PROPOSED_NOT_YET_IN_CANONICAL_DOCS):
- Apolitical donor-alignment intake rules (not present in the v0.5 ZIP)
- Donation intake lanes and screen triggers (not present in the v0.5 ZIP)

To fully productionize, insert those proposed rules into the canonical governance stack, then update facts.json citations accordingly.
